# Freecodecamp submission repository

I am following this [free online course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), And store all of the submission on this repository, it will keep update as far as I took it.

You can also give it a try, here are some of the certification I recommend (I would also take it) :

- [Responsive web design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).
- [Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).
- [Front-end Development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/).
- [API and Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/).
- [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/).

Thank you, hope this helps :)
